    "text": "Biotoxicity in Commercially Important Shellfish Undergraduate Internship in Dr. Jellison’s Lab\nI was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for Hannah Gossner’s PhD research project over the summer. This project was investigating the effects of biotoxicity on commercially important bivalve species in varying water conditions relating to climate change. In this position I cared for the lab organisms (bivalves and phytoplankton), cared for the aquaria (Neptune Systems APEX), and collected experimental data (respiration results, pseudo-feces samples, bivalve tissue, water samples, and water parameters)."

Finding Franklin Bats is an ongoing study in Franklin, NZ to understand the ecology of these bats and to educate the public. During my project I created and carried out education plans for primary school children (K-6th). I also participated in field work to locate roosts, track the movement of tagged bats, and deploy acoustic bat monitors (ABMs). After data collection, we presented our findings to the public."

I compared the vocalizations (bandwidth, center frequency, and SNR NIST quick) to the whistle from the train running through the area to investigate if any changes in bullfrog vocalizations occured before, during, and after the train whistle."
