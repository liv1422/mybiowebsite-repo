## Goals
I am interested in research and education. I really enjoy participating in science whether that be assisting others with research or conducting my own projects. I also enjoy educating others, especially the public, about animals and our environment. 

## Education
I am currently a senior at the University of New Hampshire studying Zoology with a minor in Marine Biology. I have taken classes at Shoals Marine Laboratory including Marine Mammal Biology, Sustainable Fisheries, and Shark Biology and Conservation. I was also chosen to partake in an ecology based study abroad opportunity in New Zealand with the EcoQuest Centre for Indigeneity, Ecology and Creativity.  

## Experience
I have two years of experience working as an Undergraduate Researcher in Dr. Laura Kloepper's Ecological Acoustics and Behavior lab at the University of New Hampshire. During my time in this lab I conducted acoustic research on the behavior of multiple species including giraffes, American Bullfrogs, and Moose. During my time studying abroad, I participated in research on New Zealand long-tailed bats to investigate how they are using their habitat in fragmented areas.  
I then joined Dr. Brittany Jellison's Marine Ecophysiology Lab at the University of New Hampshire where I assisted with research on the effects of ocean acidification on Eastern Oysters. I participated in an internship during the summer of 2025 within this lab as an Undergraduate Research Assistant. I am currently analyzing data from this summer internship for my own research questions.
