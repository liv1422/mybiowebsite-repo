I am really interested in working with marine mammals. My favorite marine mammal is a whale! So, ask me about whales! I took a course at the University of New Hampshire on marine invertebrates and can ID most New England marine invertebrates. 

## Goals
* I want to work with marine animals

## Education
I am currently a senior at the University of New Hampshire studying Zoology with a minor in Marine Biology. 

## Experience
I have lab experience
